Description: 

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Notes: Writing the palindrome checker first was the play. After that, it was simple iteration through all possibilities.
This solution was not elegant or fast but it got the job done.
